    "content": "Two Factor Authentication (2FA)\nUpdated\n                                                03 June 2024 13:38\n\nWhat is two factor authentication?\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is a way to add an extra layer of security to your\n                                account. It is also known as two-step verification, because after entering your username\n                                and password, an extra step is added to the login. In practice, this is usually done by\n                                means of an app on your phone with which you generate a code, which you then have to\n                                enter on the device on which you want to log in. The same goes for All You Can Learn\n                                Two-Factor Authentication.\n\nWhy use 2FA?\nWhen you have set up 2FA, your stored data is has better protection against hackers and\n                                other malicious parties. Even if someone knows your password, they can't get into your\n                                account! After all, you also need your phone to log in. It may seem inconvenient to have\n                                to enter a code every time you log in. But for many users, this extra layer of security\n                                is a wise choice. Compare it to double locking your bicycle.\n\nGoogle Authenticator\nTo set up 2FA you need an authenticator app, for example Google Authenticator. First\n                                install this app on your phone:\nAndroid\niPhone\nOptionally, you can also use another authenticator app, such as those from Microsoft or\n                                Authy.\n\nHow do I set up 2FA?\nTo enable 2FA follow these steps:\nLog in\n                                    to your All You Can Learn account.\nClick on your name at the top right and choose 'My\n                                        account'.\nA new screen will open. Click on 'Security' on the right side.\nClick the red button that says 'Enable'\nA QR-code appears on your screen. Open the authenticator app on your phone and click\n                                    the plus symbol at the bottom right. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app.\n                                    Now the authenticator app is linked to your All You Can Learn account!\nYou will see a code on your phone. You then enter this under the QR code on\n                                    your screen. Click 'Next' to continue.\nYou will then be presented with a set of ten recovery codes. You can use these codes\n                                    if your phone has been left at home, stolen or broken. Save the\n                                            recovery codes carefully in case your phone becomes unavailable! You cannot\n                                            log in without a code!Then click\n                                    'Continue'.\nDone! You now have 2FA enabled. In the future you will now always have to enter a\n                                    code after entering your email address and password. The codes are refreshed every\n                                    30 seconds. Always use the most recent code.If you don't have your phone\n                                    with you, you can use the codes you generated when turning on 2FA in step 7. Make\n                                    sure to generate new recovery codes in time when they are running out! You can do\n                                    this by going back to your 'My account' (see step 2) and clicking\n                                    the 'Generate recovery rodes' button.\n\nTurning off 2FA\nIf you no longer want to use 2FA, you can disable this extra security feature. Even if\n                                you change telephone or telephone number, you must temporarily disable 2FA. You do this\n                                by:\nGoing to 'My account' again and then clicking on '2FA'. You will\n                                    see a button on the right that allows you to disable 2FA.\n                                    Note: to disable 2FA you still have to enter a new verificationcode\nAfter you have entered the verification code (the most recent code from your\n                                    authenticator app), click 'Next'. You will then see a confirmation\n                                    that two-step verification has been disabled. After that, you no longer need to log\n                                    in with the authenticator app.\nDo you want to print\n                                        this article?

You will\n                                    now automatically be redirected to your school's environment.

This can\n                                have various causes. Here's how to check if everything is set up correctly.\nMake sure your account is linked to your school.

If this does not provide a useful answer,\n                                    please contact us.\nMake sure you and your coach are enrolled in the same learning program. You must\n                                    both be enrolled in the exact same learning program. For example\n                                    'Digitale vaardigheden' is not the same as 'Digitale vaardigheden basis'! Only when\n                                    your coach is registered for the same learning program can you select them!\nAre you and your coach both correctly associated with the same educational\n                                    institution and enrolled in the same learning program, but you still can't select\n                                    them? Then there may be a technical problem. In such a case, it is best to\n                                    contact our support department so that we can help you further.\nDo you want to print\n                                        this article?

If this is the case, your school will\n                                provide you with a prepaid code that you can activate on the platform. When you do this,\n                                your subscription will immediately become active.\n\nHow do I obtain a prepaid code?\nIf your school uses prepaid codes, you will receive them from your coach. Only employees\n                                of affiliated educational organizations can purchase prepaid codes. Therefore, you will\n                                never need to order a prepaid code yourself.\n\nHow do I redeem a prepaid code?\nCreate an account if you haven't already. You can create an account by logging in\n                                    for the first time.\nNavigate to 'Subscription' via the account menu in the top right corner and click on\n                                    it.\nLook at the bottom of the page where you will see the 'PREPAID CODE' box.\nEnter your prepaid code here, including the hyphens, and press enter.\nYour subscription is now activated, and you can enroll in a learning program!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nI paid for my license through my book list. How do I\n                                get a subscription on my account now?\nWe do not collaborate with MBO Webshop or similar organizations, so if you have already\n                                paid for your license, it is likely done through your school. You will probably receive\n                                a prepaid code from your teacher when it's time for you to start your elective. If in\n                                doubt, consult a teacher or department coordinator.\n\nI have redeemed my prepaid code, but my elective does\n                                not appear under 'My Learning Programs'. What now?\nYour subscription provides access to all learning programs on the platform, and the\n                                prepaid code does not specify which elective you will choose. Once you have activated\n                                your code, you need to enroll yourself in the appropriate learning program.\n\nMy prepaid code isn't working. What should I do?\nIf your prepaid code has already been used, you will receive a notification when you try\n                                to redeem it. In that case, it's best to contact your coach and ask for another code. If\n                                it's clear why you can't activate your prepaid code, first check if it might have worked\n                                by revisiting 'Subscription' and looking at the 'Order History' table at the bottom of\n                                the page. If you don't see your new subscription there, contact Support, but also inform\n                                your coach.\nDo you want to print\n                                        this article?

If you already know which\n                                        learning program you will follow, it's best to use the search function.\nWhen you click the tile of a course, you will see all\n                                    kinds of information about the course. For example, read the description of the\n                                    course, watch the trailer and the number of study hours (SBU). Below all the\n                                    information, click the blue button that says ‘Enroll’ to\n                                    sign up.\nSelect your coach. If the right coach is not listed, check if you are linked to the correct\n                                        organization. Also, verify with your coach whether they are already enrolled\n                                    in the same learning program. You can only choose coaches from the same\n                                        organization who are already enrolled in the same program.\nChoose the correct learning set. Usually, this will be the learning\n                                    set for the current school year. Your coach may have created their own learning set;\n                                    in that case, you will likely receive instructions from your coach on which set to\n                                    choose. If you are unsure which learning set to choose, it's best to discuss it with\n                                    your coach. We recommend against switching sets if you have already started\n                                    assignments because you cannot transfer your completed work to another learning set.\nChoose the correct level.\n\nUnenrolling\nDo you want to unenroll from a learning program, for\n                                example, because you want to stop or because you accidentally added it? That’s possible\n                                too.\nClick on the learning program you want to unenroll\n                                    from under 'My courses.'\nWithin the learning program, you will see the 'Settings' button\n                                        on the right side, below the XP bar. Click on it.\nWithin the learning program, you will see the 'Settings' button\n                                        on the right side, below the XP bar. Click on it.\nYou will see a short overview of your settings, with a 'Unenroll' button below. You\n                                    can use this button to unenroll from the learning\n                                    program.\nConfirm your choice by clicking the blue button 'Yes, unenroll me.' You are now\n                                        unenrolled from the learning program!\nConfirm your choice by clicking the blue button 'Yes, unenroll me.'

You\n                                need to enroll yourself in the correct course and select the right teacher from your\n                                school as your coach.\nAfter activating a subscription, you can enroll in one or more courses by following these\n                                steps:\nGo to ‘My Courses’ if you are not already there. (This is the first\n                                    page you see after logging in.)\nSearch for the correct title under ‘All Courses’. You can scroll\n                                    down or use the search function.\nClick on the correct course. A brief introduction text for the course will appear on\n                                    your screen.\nAt the very bottom, you will see a button labeled ‘Get Started’.\n                                    Click on it.\nChoose your coach. The name of the teacher who will coach you for your elective\n                                    should be listed. Contact your teacher if you don’t see the correct coach!\nClick on ‘Next’.\nChoose the correct learning set. In most cases, this will be the learning set for\n                                    the latest academic year, but it may be that you have agreed with your coach to\n                                    select a different learning set.\nClick on ‘Next’ again.\nChoose your level. For most courses, this is no longer relevant, so it will usually\n                                    show ‘General’, which you can click on. If you can choose between\n                                    levels 1 through 4, select the level that corresponds to your program.\nClick on ‘Get Started’. The course will open immediately, and you\n                                    can begin with your assignments!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThe coach I want to select is not listed. What should I do?In this\n                                case, the coach has not yet added the course to their list. Ask the coach to add the\n                                course, and then you will be able to select them.\nWho determines which coaches I can choose from?Usually, your school\n                                determines who the coaches are for a course. Often, these are teachers, but they could\n                                also be company mentors.\nI have already started a course but still need to choose a coach.

Then, you choose a coach, exercise set and level. Once you\n                                    have done this, you can start following the course. In this article we tell you more\n                                    about the structure of a course.\n\n1. XP's\nAt the top of the screen in every course, you will see a progress\n                                        bar, which indicates how many XP's (experience\n                                        points) you have already earned.\nXP points are earned by completing assignments, where 1\n                                        XP equals about 1 hour. The number of XP's\n                                    therefore indicates approximately how long you spend on a particular\n                                    assignment.\nOn the left side of the progress bar you can see the total number of\n                                        XP's for the course. The yellow star that says 'Final\n                                        assignment' indicates at how many XP's you may request the final\n                                    assignment or exam, if there is any. For most courses, this will be about 80% of the\n                                    total amount of XP. With the final assignment you can complete the course. The final\n                                    assignment is often an exam, but can also be another type of assignment.\n\n2. Chapters\nMost courses consist out of themes. These themes give\n                                    more structure to the assignments within the course.\n                                    These chapters give more structure to the various assignments within a course.\n                                    Usually there is no specific order in which the chapters should be completed.\n                                    However, in a couple of instances the chapters should be completed in\n                                    a specific order. When this is the case, a chapter will\n                                    be 'locked' before you have obtained a certain amount of\n                                    XP in the previous chapter.\n\n3. Assignment tiles\nBelow the progression bar you will see different types of assignment tiles. On the\n                                    assignment tile you can read the title of the assignment and see various icons. The\n                                    meaning of these icons is as follows:\nThe green icon indicates the amount of XP you can\n                                        earn by handing in the assignment\nThe purple or blue icon indicates the amount of\n                                        people you need to do this assignment\nThe red icon with the little house on it indicates\n                                        whether the assignment can be done at home\nWhen you click an assignment tile, it will be opened.\n\n4. Assignments - content\nWhen you open an assignment, you can read what you need to do and get started on the\n                                    assignment. There are different types of assignments you can encounter on the\n                                    platform. Most assignments will be action based. These\n                                    assignments may look something like this:The\n                                    assignment starts with an introduction. Here you can read\n                                    about the subject of the assignment. Often the introduction will also contain a\n                                    video.\nNext, you will get instructions on what steps exactly you\n                                    have to follow to do the assignment. Sometimes an assignment consist\n                                    of multiple parts. The assignment above for example consists\n                                    out of three parts. In each part of the assignment you have to follow different\n                                    steps.\nTo complete the assignment, you must hand in a file. Often this\n                                    will be a written report in which you have answered some questions. Besides reports,\n                                    you sometimes have to hand in video's, audio\n                                            recordings, images or other types of files. In\n                                    this way you can build a portfolio, which can later help you\n                                    prove you are ready for the final assignment. Your coach will assess your\n                                    assignments before you are allowed to take the exam!\nIn some assignments you will be handed a piece of\n                                        theory to read. To check whether you have understood this theory\n                                    completely, you have to answer a question about the subject.\n                                    This can be a multiple choice question or a drag and drop exercise for example.\n                                    These assignments may look something like this:\n\n5. Assignments - assessment\nImmediately after you hand in the assignment, you are automatically rewarded with\n                                    the corresponding amount of XP. Your coach will also\n                                    receive a message about you handing in the assignment, and they can view and assess\n                                    it. During the assessment your coach can approve or\n                                    reject the assignment. If the assignment is approved its\n                                    colour will turn green and you can keep the XP. If the assignment is\n                                        rejected, the XP will be taken off of your progress again. Your coach\n                                    will provide you with feedback for the rejected assignment you so you improve\n                                    it.\n\n6. The final assignment\nOnce you have reached the star that says 'Final\n                                        assignment' in the progress bar, a sample of your\n                                        assignments will automatically\n                                    be requested directed at your coach. Our system will\n                                    automatically generate the sample of your completed assignments. Your coach must\n                                    assess these assignments (again) and determine whether you are ready for the final\n                                    assignment. Once the coach approves the sample, you can start the final assignment.\n                                    This assignment is often an exam, but may also be another type\n                                    of assignment. After also successfully completing the final assignment, you will\n                                    have completed the entire course!\n\nFrequently asked questions:\nCan I also request the final assignment before I have made it to the\n                                            star in the progress bar? Yes, this is possible! Your\n                                        coach can manually start the sample for you. So consult your coach about this.\n                                        Remember that you usually prepare yourself for the final assignment by finishing\n                                        almost the entire course though. If you are missing parts, it is possible that\n                                        you will not be prepared optimally for the final assignment.\nWhat happens to my progress when my subscription ends or when I change\n                                            my settings? Your progress will always remain safe!

    "content": "The structure of a course\nUpdated\n                                                25 April 2023 15:39\nTo start with a course, the participant first needs to add the course to their list and\n                                select a coach and exercise set. Now, the participant can start learning!\nIn this article we will explain how our courses are built up.\n\n1. XP's\nOn top of each course, the participant will see a progress\n                                    bar indicating how many XP's (experience\n                                    points) they have earned. XP's can be achieved by handing in\n                                exercises. 1XP equals 1 hour of work. The number of XP's, thus reflects the amount of\n                                time a participant works on an exercise.\nThe exercises on the learning platform are just a part of the complete\n                                    course. Classical lessons, field trips, skills labs, and other activities\n                                form the other part of the course. It’s up to the organisation and coach how to organise\n                                this.\nOn the right hand side of the progress bar you can find the total number of\n                                    XP's that can be earned in the course. The yellow star that\n                                says ‘Final assignment’ indicates how many XPs the\n                                participant must earn to apply for the final assignment. Mostly, the bar is at 80% of\n                                the total number of XPs. The participant can finish the course by doing the final\n                                assignment. This can be an exam or assessment.   Please note! Not every\n                                course has a final assignment in the platform. In this case, it is up to you as a coach\n                                to decide when the participant is ready to finish the course.\n\n2. Chapters\nMost courses consist of multiple chapters or themes/topics. These chapters or themes are\n                                used to provide more structure to the course and exercises.\n                                Mostly, there is no specific order to go through these chapters. However, we do advise\n                                to let participants make at least one exercise from each chapter.\n\n3. Assignments\nUnderneath the progress bar you’ll find the assignment tiles. On\n                                the assignment tiles you’ll see the title of the assignment\n                                and a number of different icons. Each icon has its own\n                                meaning:\nThe green icon indicates the amount of XP you can earn by handing in the assignment\nThe purple or blue icon indicates the amount of people you need to do this\n                                    assignment\nThe red icon with the little house on it indicates whether the assignment can be\n                                    done at home\nClick on the assignment tile to open it.\n\n4. Assignments - content\nWhen a participant opens an assignment, they directly see what to do to get started. Most\n                                assignments are action based, which means that the participant has\n                                to do something. The assignment starts with a\n                                short introduction (on the left) about the subject. On the\n                                right side the participant can find the instructions. The instructions are built up in\n                                multiple steps. Please be aware that sometimes an assignment consists\n                                of multiple parts, like the one below.\nTo finish the assignment, the participant needs to hand in a\n                                    file. Depending on the exercise this can be a Word document, PDF,\n                                video, photo, audio recording, or other type of file. All the files together form a\n                                portfolio, in which the participant shows what he/she has learned and that he/she is\n                                ready for the final assignment. As a coach you review a number of the exercises to\n                                determine if the participant is ready for the final assignment.\nNext to the standard assignment, we also offer theory\n                                    based assignments. In these types of assignments the participant needs\n                                to read a piece of theory. At the end of the theory several questions are asked, to make\n                                sure the participant fully comprehends the theory. These can be multiple choice\n                                questions or drag and drop exercises.\n\n5. Assignments - review\nThe participant will receive the XP's directly after handing the assignment. As a coach\n                                you’ll receive a notification when a new assignment is handed in.\n                                You can review the assignment and provide feedback. When\n                                you approve the assignment, it will turn green in the\n                                participant’s environment. When you reject the assignment, it will\n                                turn red and the XP's will be deducted from the total progress. It is important to\n                                provide feedback. This enables the participants to improve their work.\n\n6. Final assignment\nWhen the participant reaches the star that says 'Final assignment',\n                                the system will automatically create a random sample of\n                                exercises that have been handed in. The assignments have been selected in a way that\n                                covers all the core tasks and processes from the qualification of the course.\nAs a coach, you must then (re)assess the sampled assignments. Once you approve the\n                                reviewed the sample, the participant can start the final assignment. This is often\n                                an exam, but can also be another type of assignment. After\n                                successfully completing this final assignment, the student has finished the\n                                course. Please note: not all courses include an exam or final\n                                assignment.\n\nFrequently asked questions:\nAre there answer sheets available for the courses? No, we\n                                    do not have documentation available that contains the answers to the assignments.\n                                    Most of our assignments are created in such a way that multiple answers can be\n                                    correct. The assignments focus on the learning process and interpretation of the\n                                    participant rather than a right or wrong answer. Each assignment is linked to a\n                                    (number of) learning objectives. You can use these as a starting point to review the\n                                    assignment. Some assignments also contain a coach instruction with some additional\n                                    tools.\nCan I set the minimum amount of XPs for the final assignment\n                                        myself?No, you cannot. This will always be a fixed percentage of\n                                    the total amount of XPs. However, it is possible to manually provide access to the\n                                    final assignment when you think the participant is ready. You can also make your own\n                                    learning set with less XPs. The percentage won’t change but the total amount of XPs\n                                    will.\nDo you want to print this article?
