## Exploration day

Repository for the explporation day we have at work. We build All you can learn, a dutch e-learning platform system built in Next, TypeScript, React Query and a Laravel back-end.

I will be exploring multiple things regarding AI in this repository. Or have multiple ideas.

## Support chat bot

A AI-driven chat bot that does not hallucinate and answers only based on our data. 

## A /helper menu inside Tiptap rich editor

Something along the lines of a `/` menu allows to prompt or give hints but also limit promppting. E.g. What in an question called `root square of 81` doing `/help` and typing `root square of 81` would give no answer but asking `How do i calculate root square` will give hints.

## Non AI performance optimalization

Want to check how certain values in the `next.config.ts` regerading css module bundling impact performance via analyzer.
